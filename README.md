This is a poject centered around the idea of using machine learning and Herkou.

Using Riots api for data collection,  a team of three worked on a static website that would display the data and give a view of results without being code heavy.

Python, Html5, Css, tableau, heroku (php) and scikit-learn were used in this project development.

With Leauge of legends a popular online multiplayer game being the focus, the role meta for the season was the goal.

Roles were devided down in to the riot designated roles which are: Support, Tank, Assasin, Fighter, Mage.

Using tableau we compared what were the top character choices to see if it matched the "Wining Meta"

The outcome was roughly a 70% accuracy on the win rate prediction based on Role choice, while a 50% rate based on character selection.
